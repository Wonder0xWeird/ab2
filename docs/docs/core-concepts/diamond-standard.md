# Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)

The Diamond Standard is a crucial architectural pattern used in the ABSTRACTU platform to provide upgradeable, modular smart contracts.

## Overview

The Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) allows for a contract (called a Diamond) to be composed of multiple separate contracts (called Facets). This enables modular functionality and contract upgradeability without changing the Diamond's address or state.

## Key Concepts

### Diamond

The Diamond is the main contract that users interact with. It:

- Maintains a single address and state storage
- Delegates function calls to appropriate facets
- Provides a central point of interaction for users and other contracts

### Facets

Facets are individual contracts that implement specific functionality:

- Each facet implements a set of related functions
- Facets do not maintain their own storage (they use the Diamond's storage)
- Facets can be added, replaced, or removed from the Diamond

### Diamond Cuts

A "diamond cut" is the process of adding, replacing, or removing facets from a Diamond:

- Add: Deploy a new facet and register its functions with the Diamond
- Replace: Deploy a new facet that replaces the functions of an existing facet
- Remove: Unregister functions from the Diamond

### Function Selectors

Function selectors are 4-byte identifiers for each function:

- Derived from the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature
- The Diamond uses these selectors to route calls to the appropriate facet

## ABSTRACTU Implementation

In the ABSTRACTU platform, we've implemented the Diamond Standard with the following components:

### Core Diamond Contract

```solidity
// contracts/src/core/Diamond.sol
contract Diamond {
    constructor(address _contractOwner, address _diamondCutFacet) payable {
        // Initialize Diamond storage
        // Set contract owner
        // Register DiamondCutFacet functions
    }
    
    // Fallback function for delegating calls to facets
    fallback() external payable {
        // Find the facet for the function selector
        // Delegate the call to the facet
    }
    
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

### Core Facets

ABSTRACTU implements several core facets required by the Diamond Standard:

1. **DiamondCutFacet**: Manages adding, replacing, and removing facets
2. **DiamondLoupeFacet**: Provides introspection functions to query facets and function selectors
3. **OwnershipFacet**: Manages ownership of the Diamond

### Custom Facets

ABSTRACTU extends the Diamond functionality with custom facets:

1. **SubmissionFacet**: Manages content submissions
2. **EvaluationFacet**: Handles the evaluation of submissions
3. **TokenFacet**: Manages tokenization of content (planned)

## Advantages of Using the Diamond Standard

The Diamond Standard provides several benefits for the ABSTRACTU platform:

1. **Upgradeability**: Functionality can be updated without migrating state or changing addresses
2. **Modularity**: Features are organized into logical facets for better code organization
3. **Unlimited Contract Size**: Bypasses the 24KB contract size limit through delegation
4. **Gas Efficiency**: Users only pay gas for the functions they use
5. **Single Address**: Users and integrators interact with a single contract address

## Interacting with Diamonds

When interacting with the ABSTRACTU Diamond contract:

```javascript
// Connect to the Diamond contract with the ABI of all facets
const diamondAddress = '0x...';
const diamondABI = [...]; // Combined ABI of all facets
const diamond = new ethers.Contract(diamondAddress, diamondABI, provider);

// Call functions on any facet through the Diamond
const result = await diamond.myFacetFunction(param1, param2);
```

## Security Considerations

When working with Diamond contracts:

1. **Storage Conflicts**: Facets share storage, so careful storage layout is essential
2. **Access Control**: Only authorized addresses should be able to perform diamond cuts
3. **Immutable Functions**: Critical functions should be immutable to prevent security issues
4. **Upgrade Testing**: Thoroughly test upgrades before applying them to production
