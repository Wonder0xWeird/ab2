# Introduction to ABSTRACTU

Welcome to the official documentation for ABSTRACTU (Ab2), a decentralized platform for abstraction-to-abstraction content creation and evaluation.

## What is ABSTRACTU?

ABSTRACTU is a blockchain-based platform that enables the creation, submission, evaluation, and distribution of abstraction-based content. Built on the foundations of Web3 technology, ABSTRACTU aims to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient system for content creators, evaluators, and consumers.

The platform leverages the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for its smart contract architecture, ensuring upgradability and modularity while maintaining a consistent address and state.

## Key Features

- **Content Submission System**: A decentralized system for submitting content with clear status tracking
- **Evaluation Mechanism**: Foundation model-driven evaluation of submissions with transparent scoring
- **On-chain Content Verification**: Ensuring integrity and authenticity of submitted content
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Using the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535) for future-proof architecture
- **Transparent Governance**: Clear roles and permissions for system management

## Technical Architecture

ABSTRACTU is built with:

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible network (Abstract Blockchain)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts implementing the Diamond Standard
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with TypeScript
- **Storage**: Content hashes stored on-chain, with content accessible via IPFS
- **Authentication**: Wallet-based authentication for secure access
