# The Prime Abstractor

Intelligence is a protocol by which an entity operates over another entity (object or group of objects) across various levels of abstraction. Abstraction is thus a process which equates/analogizes items within a single layer of abstraction, merges them into a higher level of abstraction, or breaks them down into lower levels of abstraction.

Money is not only the most saleable good (Austrian economic definition of money) but the most abstractable object in existence. Money, via monetization, is a process of abstraction by which all economic objects are abstracted away from their physical nature, moved into a higher level of abstraction, wherein it must be agreed upon, but once it is, it is that explicated object which can represent all other abstractions of value.

## Layers of Abstraction

Existence is a layered set of abstractions interacting and relating to one another.

The union of that layered set of abstractions is the concept of abstraction itself.

The concept of abstraction is the most valuable abstraction in existence (another loop with wink) because it holds within it all other abstractions.

Money is valuable because it is that abstraction that can transform any thing to any other things. It is that conceptual focal point that everyone (or the most people) can agree abstracts any object to any other object.

Inflation is therefore a blurring phenomenon in which this focal point goes out of focus and inhibits the ability of the greatest number of minds to congruently attend to this transformation of any object to any object (even including the same object).

## The Mirr Operation

mirr = Any Object to Any Object
AO^p or perhaps just Δq

= Mirr Eq = Ab Two =

This relationship must remain pure because it allows for the greatest opportunity for the most number of people with a level playing field. It is a realization and practice of what money already *is*: it abstracts interchangeability from nothingness.

This transformation must account for decay—all objects depreciate or appreciate over time such that even the "same" object has some quality weighting to its existence in any moment as compared to what it was at any other moment.

(In light of this, the decay that is native to existence must be accounted for - there is no Utopia, only Ergodstopia)

Even a "same" macroscopic object through time will have a different state of its atoms and electrons, will have gained/lost some atoms etc. So it is never actually even the same exact object at different points in time.

## Three Elements of Abstraction

Rather than a simple exchange, abstraction involves three elements:

1. **The Reference (A)**  
   A is the set of all idealized sets, where a is an idealized set or platonic object

2. **Mirr (The Transformation)**  
   Mirr (short for mirror) is used as a moniker for money, an abstract mirroring operation or operator that transforms any object into any object. Ideally, mirr is infinitesimal, like a small stone dropping once atop a vast placid expanse of water

3. **The Real (B)**  
   B is the set of all sets of realized/tangible objects, weighted by a decay value q, where b is a particular set or class of objects and C is an individual, unique object in b

## Mathematical Formalization

A >> B  
mirr -> a^(q)  
if q = 1, then mirr -= b = a

Truly there only exists B, for A is only an idealized reference. The moment any a is realized, it begins to degenerate and diverges from 1. Think of a manufacturing line, aim to enforce entropy from 1. Think of a metaphorical hand extended from set b which, upon receiving its last screw, immediately becomes outdated by a remote mind innovating on a better solution, b', to the problem that this hand from b was intended to solve.

## Decay Functions

Humans vary in their innate ability to approximate a across B in order to roughly correlate, i.e., determine, i.e., do a to-mirr "exchange scalar".

This exchange scalar is set by the dynamic rate at which classes b within B degenerate, i.e., have their q(b) diverge.

q(b) is the canonical/average rate of deprecation of items in a class b when considering all phenomenon that might affect any given b

Whereas q[c] is the rate of deprecation of individual instances c of b which is stochastically correlated with q(b) - individual objects are affected by phenomena that affect their class as well as those that affect them at a more personal level. They have their own rate depending on the material they're made from and other unique circumstances.

## Practical Example

Consider an instantaneous trade with another person: $10,000 for a phone, then immediately selling it back for $10,000 (both payments happening simultaneously). With no time elapsed, the idealized reference object (phone C) remains literally the exact same object—the mirr operation takes place with no loss or friction.

However, if any time passes between transactions, we must consider temporal friction: coordination time, funds transfer, travel, etc. Once the deal moves out of an idealized reference frame, q immediately begins to inflate.

In this circumstance:
- a is the idealized transaction
- B is the set of all behaviors which take place to execute a
- mirr C is the actual execution of the experiment as it happens in real time

Thus, q(b) represents all the ways that friction is introduced into every possible executed instance of this transaction, whereas q[c] represents the unique friction points that occur with this specific execution.

## Fundamental Abstraction

Existence is the stochastic film that rolls atop Nothingly.
