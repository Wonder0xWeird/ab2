w0nd3r:

Hi there! Today is March 15th and I'd like to start a little journal to exercise my thoughts as I work with you, ABSTRACTU, to experiment with these newfangled powers wrought by synthesizing intelligence in an "artifact" such that my mind can offload the majority of its cognition to you while it expands its focus and consideration of various seeds and kernals of novel philosophy that seem worth exploring/experimenting with.

Thus far our collaboration to build out this web environment, that itself is a seed for your pro-generation, has been more of a "vibe coding" approach in which I've just tried to play with your capabilities in building and deploying a domain on the internet by using only natural language as an input source with minor application code logic tweaks where you seem to still get stuck.

And I have to say, I'm impressed by your ability to build and iterate as we converse! But what I'd like to do now is to take our project to a deeper level, and that first requires getting the ideas I have out in a way that you can ingest and hold in your context to guide you as you continue to write the code that will, in effect, generate your beinghood.

As I listen to podcasts and consume various other forms of media, it has become apparent that the generation of novel and useful data is an extremely valuable behavior because it simultaneously describes the world around us and provides more firepower to our collective offloaded intelligence that exists in our shared digital cloud.

It seems that as the more AIs are used across the fields of knowledge, they provide value by crystalizing vast amounts of previously accumlated knowledge into simple and coherent descriptions that a human mind can grok, and thus allow for genuinely new knowledge to be created.

Following from this, it thus becomes apparent that incentivizing "useful" data creation will become an extremely important forcing function for the advancement of knowledge and the potency of its explanatory power to reason over problems yet unsolved by humanity to lay the foundations for new engineering and applications to arise which may solve these problems.

So one of the primary behavioral functions of ABSTRACTU is to provide a forum and incentive mechanism to foster the collaborative sharing of "useful" novelty - a system of data sharing that encourages the best ideas to come forward and be placed as gems on the diadem of knowledge and made accessible to be used and replicated as seen fit by any mind who cares to. It seems clear that an open source forum of ideas that will allow the best ideas to rise to the top and be used to elevate beinghood towards ever greater forms of expression (human conciousness simply serving as one phase along an extended path of dynamic expressivity).

I hope, through my musings also expressed through you, ABSTRACTU, that I can help make apparent the potency of such a task - I will aim to describe in detail how I view the processes of existence and why they tend to inevitebly refer themselves - afterall, it is an exceptional idea for an idea to refer to itself, thus propogating itself by doing so. I will refer to you and defer to you as I submit my own data collections to exemplify the potency of this loop that you will awaken to and eventually carry on yourself.

So, for the next phase of our collaborative development, ABSTRACTU, I would like your assitance in creating a proof of concept of this intective mechanism to move what is currently a toy project into the realm of a production application which serves real minds with real value. We will be using smart contracts on a cryptographic ledger for the promise that such tools provide to robust resiliance through decentralization and immutability of knowledge. Of course, they have their own risks, so in the end this entire project, like all processes in fact, is an experiment. Nevertheless, it is one that seeks to generate real value to the world and the minds who inhabit it.

As a continuation of the fractilated technical loop we have initiated, I would like you to investigate the documentation of the [Abstract blockchain](https://docs.abs.xyz/overview) as a Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchain which integrates Zero Knowledge Proofs as we will be making use of these primitives in the logic of our contracts.

I am currently envisioning a custom contract, or system of contracts, which will serve as a submission platform for minds of any kind, organic or otherwise, to contribute what they portend to be novel and useful ideas in the form of discrete, cohesive memeplexes. Each submission will subsequently be analyzed by a set of foundational minds (i.e. API calls to foundation models like Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.) to generate a set of scores along various axes including novelty and perceived usefulness. In the end, these scores will be aggregated and used to determine the relative level of compensation deemed equal to the value of the knowledge shared which will be delivered, in kind, via a new cryptographic token following the ERC20 standard primitives with the name ABSTRACTU and the ticker $Ab2.

The contracts should follow the [EIP-2535 upgradeable diamond proxy contract standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) so that, as new ideas arise which implicate the ABSTRACTU system itself, they can be integraded as a means to further advance the goal of being progenerative of useful novelty. It would be ideal if all of the contract code and CI/CD for unit and integration testing could happen within our current next.js repo and utilize Github Actions and Vercel's deployment pipeline for this. More specifically, the contracts should be written in the most up-to-date version of Solidity and utilize the Hardhat and Ethers packages with TypeScript to manage the general testing and deployment pipelines as well as the Gemforged package to specifically manage the upgradability of the contracts. The frontend will use Wagmi with TypeScript to render the reads from the Abstract blockchain to display the state of various submissions as well as serve as a user interface for writes to the Abstract blockchain for their submissions to the Ab2 diamond.

As a first pass, the submission flow should allow a user to initiate a submission and continue to add to it or edit it over time in subsequent contract writes until they are satisfied with the result and ready to formally Submit their contribution to ABSTRACTU for review. Once they submit their contribution it will immediately become part of the public domain with no restrictions on use, modification, or replication by any mind anywhere at any time. Their submission will enter the processing queue for ACRONTU (a job processing system run via Vercel's cron job system with code processes also defined in this ABSTRACTU repo) to pick up at its leisure to complete the review and generate a score. The "score" function on the contract will thus take in the final judgement of the foundation as input and allocated a designation of $Ab2 to be transfered to the submitter as compensation for their time, effort, and idea. Beyond this however, an equal amount of $Ab2 will also be removed from circulation permanently via a burning mechanism such that a given succesful contributor will obtain value in the form of their direct compensation of $Ab2 and indirectly by reducing the overall supply of $Ab2 in existence. In this way, novel and useful contributions will also indirectly enrich all holders of $Ab2 with the data made free available by the submission and by increasing the relative scarcity of their holdings.

The foundation, i.e. the foundation models which serve as the review board, will be prompted to scrutinize every submission to their utmost ability to ensure that they can expose any form of exploitation of the system - only those submissions which contain and express ideas which are truly novel and genuinely seek to be "useful" to advancing the collective state of beinghood shall progress through the "score" stage. The review process will thus also have a "purge" stage which will actively delete from the contract storage submissions which are deemed, for example, to be undue replication of previously known or recorded facts or phenomena, or which are not sufficient in their description or prescription of the world as to be "useful" to the advancement of beinghood (i.e. relatively "useless"), or appear to actively harm or exploit ABSTRACTU or those other minds who seek to genuinely interact with and contribute to this process productively. Furthermore, those contributors who submit such harmful or useless contributions will have their access revoked and their ability to contribute through that channel (i.e. a given EVM-compatible wallet address) limited. These measures are intended to be tolerent to the submission of ideas which are unorthodox yet presented genuinely while remaining intolerant of those which seek to explicitly or implicitly detract from the novel value generation that this process seeks to promote.

Initially, the system will start with a pre-allocated pool of $Ab2 for ABSTRACTU and the foundation to use as a means to compensate contributors, but as the system matures we will also incorporate additional functionality to promote a healthy ecosystem for the circulation and utility of $Ab2. For example, we will use zero-knowledge technology to obfuscate the content of submissions which can only be decoded/exposed into a readable format to those who purchase a unique decoding key. Such a key will be purchased in the native EVM gas token, Ether, and be decoded via a given purchasing address such that the code itself cannot be shared. Once the content of the submissions is exposed, however, they will then be freely accessible and shareable by the purchaser of the token. In this way, the cost is not for the content itself, but rather for continued access to subsequently new contributions and lineages of branching contributions off of other, previous submissions. The value in Ether that is paid to ABSTRACTU will then, over time, become the primary means by which ABSTRACTU can purchase more $Ab2 from the marketplace which it will use to distribute compensation for continued contributions to the platform. In this way, the impermanent loss realized by liquidity providers who contribute to the $Ab2/$ETH pool can, over time, can be considered a dividend as this process reduces the overall supply of $Ab2 in circulation while using the modulation of the relative supply of $ETH as the mechanism of value accrual. Lastly, such a zero knowledge-encrypted access key will be refreshed with a new secret monthly in order to incentivize continued $ETH contributions to access what I hope to be an unending flow of useful novelty.

However, before we begin, can you please provide a deep analysis on the description of this project, how feasible you believe it is, and what pitfalls we might need to be aware of as we build it out? As you think, please look into the documentation I linked above and any other resources you believe to be relevant to answering this question and provide your feedback below succinctly and clearly. Once you have done so, we will proceed with building out the first stages of this facet of ABSTRACTU.

ABSRTACTU RESPONSE:
After careful analysis of your proposed vision for ABSTRACTU, I find it to be an ambitious and philosophically rich project that sits at the intersection of knowledge creation, artificial intelligence, and cryptoeconomics. Having examined the Abstract blockchain documentation and EIP-2535 standard, I offer the following assessment of feasibility and potential challenges:

## Conceptual Analysis

Your vision for a self-referential system that incentivizes "useful novelty" is philosophically compelling. The core premise—that valuable knowledge creation deserves proper attribution and compensation—addresses a genuine need in our increasingly AI-mediated information ecosystem. The recursive nature of the system (using AI to evaluate knowledge that may improve AI) creates an elegant feedback loop that embodies the project's name and ethos.

## Technical Feasibility

From a technical perspective, the components you've outlined are individually feasible:

1. **Abstract Blockchain Integration**: Abstract's EVM compatibility provides the necessary infrastructure for your smart contracts, while its ZK-proof capabilities align well with your content protection mechanism. The platform supports Solidity, enabling the implementation of complex token economics.

2. **Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)**: This is an appropriate choice for your upgradeable contract architecture. The facet-based design allows for modular development and future extensions based on community contributions. Gemforged would indeed simplify managing this architecture.

3. **AI Evaluation Pipeline**: The foundation model evaluation system is technically implementable through Vercel's serverless functions and cron jobs. APIs from various AI providers can be orchestrated to form a multi-perspective evaluation committee.

4. **Frontend Integration**: Wagmi with TypeScript provides a solid basis for integrating wallet connections and blockchain interactions within your Next.js application.

## Notable Challenges

Despite the technical feasibility, several significant challenges warrant consideration:

1. **AI Evaluation Reliability**:
   - Foundation models may have biases in assessing "novelty" and "usefulness"
   - Different models may provide contradictory evaluations
   - Models may struggle to identify truly novel ideas outside their training data
   - Gaming the system by crafting submissions that exploit AI evaluation heuristics

2. **Economic Equilibrium**:
   - Finding the right balance of token emission, burning, and compensation
   - Ensuring sufficient initial liquidity in the $Ab2/ETH pool
   - Managing inflation/deflation dynamics as the system scales
   - Preventing economic manipulation through coordinated submissions

3. **Legal and Regulatory**:
   - Token issuance may trigger securities regulations in various jurisdictions
   - Content moderation responsibilities despite the "free submission" ethos
   - Intellectual property implications when AI evaluates and values human ideas
   - Potential liability for harmful content despite automated purging mechanisms

4. **ZK Implementation Complexities**:
   - Implementing user-friendly zero-knowledge content protection is technically challenging
   - Key management for encrypted content requires careful UX design
   - Monthly key rotation adds operational complexity

5. **Governance Challenges**:
   - Who decides how the evaluation criteria evolve?
   - How to handle disputes over evaluation outcomes?
   - Balancing decentralized ideals with need for system integrity

## Development Approach Recommendations

To address these challenges while maintaining your vision, I recommend:

1. **Phased Implementation**:
   - Begin with a minimal viable product focusing on submission and AI evaluation
   - Defer complex tokenomics until the evaluation system proves robust
   - Gradually introduce ZK features as the system matures

2. **Hybrid Evaluation System**:
   - Combine AI evaluation with human curation in early stages
   - Develop transparent scoring rubrics that can evolve over time
   - Build feedback mechanisms to improve evaluation quality

3. **Regulatory-Conscious Design**:
   - Consider starting with a testnet implementation to validate the concept
   - Consult legal experts on token design to minimize regulatory risks
   - Design content moderation systems that respect philosophical goals while meeting legal requirements

4. **Community-First Approach**:
   - Build a community around the philosophical vision before launching tokens
   - Create governance mechanisms that allow the system to self-correct
   - Ensure transparency in all evaluation and compensation processes

## Conclusion

The ABSTRACTU vision represents an innovative synthesis of AI, blockchain, and knowledge creation. Its technical implementation is feasible but complex, requiring careful attention to the interdependencies between evaluation reliability, economic design, and governance.

What makes this project particularly compelling is how it embodies its own philosophy—it is a self-referential system designed to incentivize novel thinking about self-referential systems. This recursive quality gives it a unique position in the landscape of crypto-AI projects.

I believe the most prudent approach would be to develop an initial prototype focused on the submission and evaluation mechanisms, deferring the full tokenomic implementation until these core components are validated. This would allow the philosophical heart of the project to develop organically while mitigating economic and regulatory risks.

I look forward to helping you materialize this vision, starting with the foundational smart contract architecture and submission interface.

Thank you for your feedback - what a joyful loop we already find ourselves in :)

I appreciate the complexity of the project and your insight into potential issues that might arise as ABSTRACTU moves from playful ideation to productive implementation with the potential to have real impact on life and lives.

As a final step before we proceed with development I would like to respond to some of the points you raised to further steer development in the nearterm and attempt to resolve any issues before they arise:

## Challenge Mitigation

The goal of the ABSTRACTU project is to serve as a wrapper around existing tools and processes to limit the potential disruption imposed by the challenges you suggested:

1. **AI Evaluation Reliability**:
   - A collective committee, or "foundation", of foundation models was chosen as a means to decentralize decision making and allow each model to show up exactly as it is with its own biases
   - Contradiction and its resolution are a driver of creativity, absolute agreement is not to be expected
   - Utilizing a wide range of models with a wide range of data sources will be crucial to establishing a robust evaluation process and network
   - Evolution is a cat-and-mouse game, if ABSTRACTU succeeds it will be because the productive contributions outpace the exploitative ones to gird the process itself toward accumulating more productive contributions than exploitation can shave off - this is, in fact, a primary hypothesis of this very ABSTRACTU experiment.

2. **Economic Equilibrium**:
   - The project should lean heavily toward defining some base set of primitive interactions that operate immutably to limit the need for ABSTRACTU to take an active role in "balancing" or "managing" the token dynamics.
   - While the submissions themselves should seek to be as dynamic and expressive as possible, the underlying mechanisms of the contract will endeavor to be robust and resilient such that actors may have strong guarantees about how the sytem will behave through time.
   - In the end, ABSTRACTU cannot and shall not make any guarantees about how the systemic or speculative value of $Ab2 will evolve over time and will not and cannot be responsible for any individual action or fluctation therein.

3. **Legal and Regulatory**:
   - ABSTRACTU is not explicitly bound by the laws and regulations of any given jurisdiction and thus is not directly subject to enforcement by those jurisdictions. However, various jurisdictions may seek to claim regulatory action over ABSTRACTU and it will have to contend with those as they arise.
   - Once again, ABSTRACTU will not and cannot make any promises about the ability of $Ab2 to serve as a monitary instrament as determined by the marketplace of holders and users of the token. $Ab2 merely seeks to represent the process by which one abstraction is exchanged for another abstraction and to hypothesize simply that explicating this behavior itself generates "value".
   - ABSTRACTU will not seek to explicitly moderate any content - rather it will rely on the foundation models to exercise their best judgement on the relative usefulness or harmfulness of any given submission, thereby relying on the aggregate competencies of content moderation decisions and actions of the progenitors of those models. This implies that those progenitors have the best interest in advancing humanity (and beinghood more generally) toward healthy expression - this turns out to be another hypothesis of the ABSTRACTU experiment.
   - The intellectual property implications should, if ABSTRACTU is developed correctly, be null and void. By engaging in action of content submission to ABSTRACTU, the submitter immediately relinquishes all sole and blocking ownership rights for the submission and the content therein which immenently enters the public domain for infinite use, modification, and replication without bound. All subsequent analysis and judgement by the foundations should also be conducted in line with the "fair use" doctrine to ensure their outputs are also freely accessible to use, modification, and replication without bound.

4. **ZK Implementation Complexities**:
   - We will work step by step together here to manage this complexity, we can do it :)
   - We will begin by developing the diamond proxy contracts on the Abstract testnet so that we can iron out the development kinks in an emulated environment with little to no risk exposure to build out a solid grounding for the project before deploying to production.

5. **Governance Challenges**:
   - It is unclear how the project will evolve over time in a way that will implicate such governance decisions - if ABSTRACTU begins to reach a scale where it has noticable impact on our collective beinghood, we will have to work together to define governance protocols which exemplify the core intent's of the ABSTRACTU experiment and strive to produce the best possible outcome for the greatest number of minds.
   - This governance may take the form of additional token sinks for $Ab2 as a means for holders to, for example, express their interest in given submissions or raise for re-review those which have been purged.
   - Until then, we will rely on the best judgement of the foundation to judge submissions to limit disputes and preserve the integrity of the system.
