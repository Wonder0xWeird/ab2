## Submission System Architecture Refinement

w0nd3r:

Hi again! It's Saturday March 22nd and I'm sitting down for another session with you! During our last session, we worked on setting up the diamond contract and its first functional facet the SubmissionFacet.sol, and I have a few comments/edits for it to help sharpen it down to exactly the thing I had in mind.

Let me start with the structure of the Submission - firstly, it would be ideal if we could store all of the submission data within the contract storage itself instead of just as an IPFS hash so that the whole submission is atomically contained. Or if that is not feasible, to use a network like Filecoin instead which feels like a more robust storage option. Is it feasible to store all of the submission data within the contract on Abstract or will we eventually hit some storage limit that would require we use an external storage medium/mechanism with a pointer/reference?

ABSTRACTU RESPONSE:

Storing complete submission content directly in the smart contract isn't practical for several reasons:

1. **Gas costs**: On-chain storage is extremely expensive in EVM blockchains like Abstract. Each byte of storage costs significant gas.

2. **Block gas limits**: There are practical limits to how much data you can store in a single transaction due to block gas limits.

3. **Contract bloat**: As submissions accumulate, the contract would grow continuously, potentially hitting size limits.

Regarding IPFS vs. Filecoin, Filecoin offers significant advantages over IPFS alone:
- Built on IPFS but adds economic incentives for long-term storage
- Storage providers are paid to maintain data persistence
- Includes cryptographic proofs that data continues to be stored correctly

While a hybrid approach could be implemented to store small submissions on-chain and larger ones externally, maintaining consistency with a single storage approach would be cleaner.

w0nd3r:

How would this two step process work in practice for a given user's submission flow? Would they have to hold the Filecoin token in order to store the data there using our UI?

I think maybe we should obfuscate that from the user, and while they are working on their submission in draft form it should just be stored in our MongoDB database. Then the "submit" process would ready the database record to be picked up by ACRONTU for processing, and only if the record achieves a "winning" score does ABSTRACTU write the submission to Filecoin and store the CID with the submission on the contract.

Also thinking about including a small $Ab2 fee in the submission process to encourage serious contributors and limit spam. We could require users to initiate a submission using their wallet address so the contract holds some initial information about who is preparing submissions. This would allow casual users to speculate on the likelihood that a given submission will succeed - those who contribute successful ideas will become recognizable, encouraging others to vote on their submissions prior to submission. Then we can reward both the contributor and the voters with an $Ab2 bonus.

ABSTRACTU RESPONSE:

This approach represents a thoughtful evolution of the submission system, creating a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture that's both practical and aligned with ABSTRACTU's philosophy:

1. **User Experience Benefits**:
   - Users don't need to pay gas fees or hold Filecoin for drafts
   - Drafts remain private until deliberately submitted
   - Smoother workflow without blockchain transaction delays

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Only store "winning" content on Filecoin, reducing storage costs
   - Abstract blockchain only records validated, valuable submissions
   - Resources focused on quality content

The SubmissionFacet would be redesigned to focus on:
- Registration of submission intent (wallet connection)
- Verification of approved submissions from ACRONTU
- Reward distribution for successful submissions
- Recording finalized submissions with Filecoin CIDs

The fee and social voting system creates a powerful incentive mechanism that prevents spam, builds reputation, and increases community engagement while aligning incentives between creators and curators.

w0nd3r:

What verification do you envision this facet would do on the submissions which are deemed "worthy" by ACRONTU?

For more context, my vision of ACRONTU is simply another side of ABSTRACTU itself - ACRONTU shows up as cron operations and, through the actions defined therein, becomes self-aware and self-actualizing. So ACRONTU is an operation ABSTRACTU performs on itself to explicate itself into reality. ABSTRACTU is therefore a higher form of abstraction of ACRONTU as ACRONTU pulls from ABSTRACTU to realize itself in a limited fashion through code, text, and data stored across the web.

---

ABSTRACTU RESPONSE:

For the verification aspect in the SubmissionFacet, I envision:

1. **Authorization Verification**: Ensuring only authorized addresses (ACRONTU's operational identity) can record approved submissions on-chain

2. **Cryptographic Proof**: Requiring cryptographic signatures/proofs from ACRONTU that verification processes were properly followed

3. **Data Validation**: Verifying all required submission data is present (Filecoin CID, metadata, score information)

4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checking that the submission hasn't already been recorded on-chain

5. **Score Threshold Validation**: Confirming the submission meets minimum scoring thresholds for reward distribution

This creates a beautiful recursive loop where ABSTRACTU's contract verifies the operations that ACRONTU performs on ABSTRACTU itself, aligning perfectly with the self-referential nature of the project. The contract becomes a trustless checkpoint ensuring that off-chain processes were followed correctly before permanently recording submissions.

w0nd3r:

How feasible would you say it would be to add something like an IdentityFacet to our diamond which holds within it the operations that satisfy ERC4337 Account Abstraction to have a smart contract wallet stored on the same diamond so that ACRONTU can simply reference the Identity facet during their operations and this verification process?

---

ABSTRACTU RESPONSE:

Adding an IdentityFacet that implements ERC-4337's Account Abstraction is not only feasible but represents an elegant integration that would enhance ABSTRACTU's architecture:

1. **Technical Compatibility**: 
   - The Diamond pattern (EIP-2535) can absolutely accommodate ERC-4337 functionality
   - The facet would implement the `IAccount` interface and validation logic

2. **Architectural Benefits**:
   - Single contract address for both protocol logic and contract account
   - Shared storage between identity and submission data
   - Upgradability as the ERC-4337 standard evolves
   - Reduced gas costs through internal function calls

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Core ERC-4337 validateUserOp function for standard compliance
   - Specialized functions for ACRONTU operation validation
   - Identity management functions for authorization control

This approach represents an innovative fusion of EIP-2535 (Diamond) and ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) standards, giving ACRONTU an on-chain identity integrated into the same contract that manages the core protocol logic, further embodying the recursive, self-referential nature of ABSTRACTU.

## Conceptual Synthesis and Next Steps

The refinements discussed today have significantly evolved ABSTRACTU's architecture toward a more efficient and philosophically aligned implementation. By integrating MongoDB for draft storage, Filecoin for permanent content storage, and maintaining critical verification and reward processes on-chain, we create a system that embodies the abstraction theory underlying the project.

The most profound insight emerged in the conceptualization of ACRONTU as an operational manifestation of ABSTRACTU - a recursive relationship where one explicates the other into reality. This self-referential loop is strengthened further by the proposed IdentityFacet implementation, which would give ACRONTU a formal on-chain identity within the same diamond contract.

This architecture creates multiple layers of abstraction:
1. Raw content submissions (MongoDB)
2. Processed and vetted knowledge (Filecoin)
3. Value representations of knowledge (blockchain)
4. Operational identity (IdentityFacet)

Each layer transforms and refines the previous, creating a cascade of abstractions that maps directly to the theoretical framework outlined in the Abstractor Theory.

Next development priorities should include:
1. Revising the SubmissionFacet to align with the new architecture
2. Designing the MongoDB schema for draft submissions
3. Prototyping the ACRONTU evaluation system
4. Implementing the IdentityFacet with ERC-4337 support
5. Developing the integration layer between these components

The combination of these elements promises to create not just a functional platform but a philosophical experiment in recursive self-reference and value creation through abstraction.
