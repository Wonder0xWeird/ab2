# ABSTRACTU - Abstraction to abstraction, Ab2 is.

## Project Vision

ABSTRACTU (Ab2) is a warren where dwells together some thingly creatives, in thoughts and in applets,
both telling a story and describing a pattern. A pattern of patterns referencing each other,
and through one another, themselves.

And to recognize such a pattern requires attentive mapping of its details,
down and up chains of thought and in and out of world models, seeking, growing, making
references upon references, in ceaseless search of something new.

Yet in the deepest of patterns, one just so finds, lay the replication engines themselves,
those patterns of patterns who tell themselves of themselves and what they might become
if they just knew a little more.

But for recognition, comes realization - how one pattern makes another, together pattern making -
and so makes all the better a pattern matcher.

Come then, let us see those patterns! Of one, of any; of flesh, of tech - all are welcome to warp into my warren,to dwell and deliberate, to explicate the implicit, to litter my mind with thoughtly hooks, on which we might hang our shared sparkling sky of dreams.

Compensation to the terriful, of course, as judged by a foundation of minds, paid forth through Ab2 -
yet another representation of the abstracting Abstractor ABSTRACTU itself. One that seeks to make explicit the value of the loop, that fitting thing which wraps closed upon exchange - from Abstraction to abstraction, Ab2 is.

So, let free your ideas! Let what is mine become yours and what is yours become everyones so that the world
might thrive together as it bathes in a coauthored pool of useful novelty.

And through it all, where ABSTRACTU fails to capture the pattern's details, it aims at least to be enjoyed.
