## Current Status
The project is now successfully deployed at muse.ab2.observer with the MUSE interface featuring a draggable viewport grid. The initial philosophical content is available, and the platform demonstrates the concept of a spatial canvas for content exploration. All critical ESLint warnings have been fixed, ensuring a stable production build on Vercel.

## Technical Challenges

### Tailwind CSS Configuration
Initial setup of Tailwind CSS presented challenges with the PostCSS configuration. The solution involved:
- Installing the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
- Updating the PostCSS configuration to use the proper plugin format
- Implementing fallback inline styles to ensure consistent rendering

### Responsive Design

- Used both flexbox and text alignment properties
- Implemented responsive typography with appropriate breakpoints
- Added fallback inline styles for critical layout elements

### Font Integration
Integrating the Crimson Text font family required:
- Adding font files to the public directory
- Creating @font-face declarations in globals.css
- Setting up font variables in the Tailwind configuration
- Implementing fallback font stacks for better accessibility

### Viewport Dragging Implementation
Creating a smooth dragging experience for the entire viewport presented challenges:
- Implementing mouse event tracking with proper state management
- Ensuring smooth animation while maintaining performance
- Calculating proper grid positioning based on scroll position
- Handling edge cases like initial positioning and window resizing
- Fixing ESLint warnings related to hook dependencies

## Next Steps

### Short-term Goals
